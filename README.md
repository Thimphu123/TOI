# Welcome to TOI 🚀
Welcome to my collection of solutions to the **Thailand Olympiad in Informatics (TOI)** problemset! 🎉


## What's This About?
This repository contains my personal solutions to various **TOI** competitive programming problems. If you're into algorithms, data structures, and solving mind-bending problems, you're in the right place! I made these solutions from scratch, tackling each problem step-by-step.


## Why Did I Do This?
As someone passionate about competitive programming, I love the thrill of solving challenging problems. This repository is my journey of learning, improving, and sometimes struggling through those tricky TOI problems. 😅


## How It's Organized
Each folder corresponds to a specific TOI problem, with code and explanations included where needed. The solutions are in [language you used] (feel free to check them out!), and I’ve added comments to make things a bit clearer.


## How You Can Use It
Feel free to explore the solutions, test them out, and even suggest improvements. If you're also working on TOI problems, I'd love to hear about your approach!


## Issues 🛠️
If you find any bugs, errors, or just something that looks off in my solutions, don't hesitate to let me know! You have two options:
1. **Open an issue**: Just go to the "Issues" tab, describe the problem, and I'll take a look.
2. **Submit a pull request**: If you’ve already found a fix or improvement, feel free to submit a pull request. I’d love to see your approach!

Whether it's a suggestion, an improvement, or a mistake I missed, your feedback helps me grow! 💡
